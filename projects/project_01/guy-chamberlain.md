# Guy - Project 01 Feedback

Hey Guy. You did an outstanding job on this project.  It works so well! You also seemed to get everything done that you wanted to, so that is great.  Are you planning to keep on working on this?  But enough of the compliments, time to get on to the code!

_Readme_

Readmes are really important.  Not just for you but also for potential employers etc.  Try not to make them to code-focussed - more about what the application is about, the technologies that are used, setup instructions, point out existing bugs and features that you want to add next.  Think about as if you had to explain an entire application without showing a single line of code for the moment.  [This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme#answers) isn't a bad description of what should go in there.

_Gemfile_

Some cool Gems in here, well done on getting some of them up and running!

_App/Assets_

JS...

Really nice clean Javascript, and good use of Gon as well. As you have jQuery in the project, it's probably best to just use that for finding the canvas etc. But this is great.

CSS...

Great CSS!  I tend to always stick to EMs or percentages for my CSS as it makes it easier to make responsive, but this is all very good.

_Controllers_

Great work on getting multiple types of login up and running!

- I'd like to see that you validate that there is a file to upload before you try and send it to Cloudinary
- Really cool to see you making sure someone isn't logged in as a Jobseeker and an Employer

Your controllers are amazing though, there isn't much I can comment on!

_Models_

Really nice associations and good use of validations. I'd like to see a few more validations, for example the structure of emails etc. But this is really good.

_Views_

Good, cleanly indented view code.  I tend to avoid using br tags as they are hard to style but if that is the only thing I can pick out, you are doing outrageously well.  Remember to remove commented out code.  Instead of using ` if ! `, the Ruby way is to just use unless, it makes it make a little bit more sense.  You have quite a lot of stuff sitting in the application.html.erb, it's often best to make a partial for the nav for example.  This is all really good though!

_Config_

Nice clean routes.

_DB_

Good seeds file, and good migrations and schema.


You have done a really great job on all of this though Guy. Great stuff! Looking forward to seeing what you build next.
