# Guy - Tic Tac Toe Project Feedback

Your project was really, really good, Guy. Your code is outrageously nice, well-indented and shows that you really understand everything we have been trying to get across.  Anyway, here are some comments:

## HTML

Your HTML is really clean and well-indented.

- When you are using attributes on HTML elements, you need to make sure you wrap the value in quotes
- Try to avoid writing javascript in the HTML - instead of the onload function on the body, you should use window.onload or $(document).ready in javascript for example - same with all the click handlers
- People tend to avoid using tables, but nice work on getting it done with it
- Probably best to avoid having the form around the table as well

But nice work.

## CSS

Very nice again, but a couple of comments:

- Always best to use a digital value, most browsers will struggle knowing how to represent cms due to pixel density - so best to use pixels (and they know how to make it appropriate)
- When applying borders, make sure you give a value such as pixels because some browsers don't know how to use keywords

Your CSS is nice, though.

## JS

Your Javascript code is really good.

- Make sure you always have curly brackets after if statements (think line 48)
- Remember that semicolons aren't optional
- Amazing AI stuff
- Always use === (line 30)

Really nice code mate.


This is incredible though, Guy. Very impressive.
