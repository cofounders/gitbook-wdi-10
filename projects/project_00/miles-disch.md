# Miles - Tic Tac Toe Project Feedback

Really nice work on this Miles. I know that you got through this really quickly so well done on that, but also great work on getting that site done as well. Lots of stuff done in a short period of done. It's impressive.  Let's have a look at the code now!

## HTML

Your HTML is clean and well-indented.  Make sure you change the title of the file so that it is something that actually makes sense.  Probably put your CSS above the JS as well, otherwise things can go wrong.  But very nice!

## CSS

Very nice again, not too much going on which is fine.  Remember that divs have display: block by default so there is no need to set that.

## JS

Wow, this is really nice code.  A couple of comments though:

- I'd love to see a few more comments about what is going on, there is some code that could be hard next time someone reads it so always worth commenting
- Make sure you delete commented out code
- Probably worth having some code that makes sure those for loops in the compare function don't get run if there aren't enough moves (i.e. under 4 moves so far)
- Also, with the document ready thing, instead of having a full anonymous function, you could just say this - ` $(document).ready( t3.init ); ` - which is nice and short and should do the same thing.


Really great code though, Miles.  Very impressed!  Make sure you come and grab me if you want to have a chat about anything - always happy to help! And I am happy to go through the hostels website with you if you want to have a chat about it.
